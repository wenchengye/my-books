                   DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DMS) 


  What's Here?
  ---------------

  Welcome to the cutting-edge world of indexing and searching 
  HTML documents.


  System Requirements
  -------------------

  * Java 1.4.x or higher


  Getting Started
  ---------------

  0. Make sure your current working directory is the directory
     containing this file (we'll call it DMS_HOME).

  1. Index the example documents in the 'doc' directory:

      Unix
      ----
      > sh bin/indexAll.sh

      Windows
      -------
      > bin/indexAll.bat

  2. Run an example search:

      Unix
      ----
      > sh bin/search.sh people

      Windows
      -------
      > bin/search.bat people

  3. Index your own HTML document, for example:

      Unix
      ----
      > sh bin/index.sh ~/mydocs/index.html

      Windows
      -------
      > bin/index.sh ~/mydocs/index.html


  We hope this automation gives you more time to enjoy life!
